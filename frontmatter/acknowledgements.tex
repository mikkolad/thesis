\sectionhidenum{Acknowledgements}

%I’m deeply indebted to my lovely wife, Kristina Arnrup Thorsbro, without whom this thesis wouldn't exist. Quitting my well paid job and becoming a student is not a decision you take lightly. Kristina did not so much as flinch at my crazy idea and has been at my side and supporting me every step of the way on this journey.
%
%I would also like to extend my deepest gratitude to my supervisor Nils Ryde, who with his extreme generosity has included me in his scientific collaborations from day one and has trusted me to lead the work on several occasions. Nils Ryde and my co-supervisors, Hampus Nilsson and Henrik Jönsson, have deep know\-ledge of the field, which they have shared willingly and patiently in spite of my constant questioning. For this I am very grateful.

%For the writing of my thesis I am deeply indebted to Colin Carlile, Florent Renaud, Rebecca Forsberg and Kasper Brandt Nyegaard; Colin for his meticulous and thorough effort to help me improve my English writing skills, Florent for for being present all summer and willing to discuss all the scientific ideas that I wanted to put in my thesis, Rebecca for helping with such a good translation of my English popular summary into Swedish and Kasper for doing the layout of the front page.

%Mike Rich is an inspiration to me with his great enthusiasm for astronomy and extremely wide knowledge of the field. I am especially thankful for our time together at the Keck telescope and being taught how to enjoy life on Hawai'i. I am also very grateful for the time Mike hosted me at UCLA and in his home in Bel Air, Los Angeles---I am looking forward to the next trip.
%
%Mathias Schultheis is also an inspiration to me showing how it is possible to be a great astronomer and still keep both feet grounded on the earth. I am very grateful for the many times that Mathias has hosted me both at the observatory in Nice, but also in his home in Mougins. Who would have thought that it was so productive to sit and work at a beach café at the Côte d'Azur. I am especially thankful for the opportunity to visit and work with Mathias for a month at the observatory in Nice---I can imagine spending more time there!

%I am grateful for the collaboration that I have had on the Galactic centre work; in particular Livia Origlia and Tobias Fritz have been along for the entire project and have taught me a lot. A special thanks goes out to Livia for visiting us in Lund and teaching me the ins and outs of the REDSPEC data reduction kit.
%
%The LUMCAS collaboration on laboratory astrophysics with Malmö University has a special place in my time as PhD student. I have greatly enjoyed going almost weekly to Malmö for a fresh change of air, and I am grateful that Per Jönsson, Henrik Hartman, Tomas Brage, Lars Engström and the rest of the crew are so warm and friendly. And yes, let us do that yttrium paper this autumn, it will be great fun!
%
%The Galactic centre project would not have been a reality without the yearly and fantastic work shops in Sexten in the Dolomites, Italy, hosted by Francesca Matteucci and Carlo Morossi. Going there every year, sharing my results and getting incredible feedback has been a corner stone of my work. In particular, discussions at Sexten with Francesca Matteucci and Emanuele Spitoni has provided me with good inspiration.
%
%I am thankful towards Anish Amarsi and Karin Lind for hosting me in Heidelberg, Germany, and teaching me the ways of NLTE calculations. I am also thankful towards Chris Sneden, Greg Mace and Melike Afsar for hosting me at UC Austin, Texas, USA, discussing my work and looking into making future observations with IGRINS a possibility---I hope to get the chance to observe with this instrument.
%
%A special thanks to my friends and colleagues at the Depart of Astronomy and Theoretical Physics. In particular Noemi Schaffer and Eric Andersson for being brilliant office-mates, Lennart Lindegren for being my excellent undergraduate supervisor and Dainis Dravins for sharing his immense depth of knowledge over the years. And a shout out to all the awesome people that have joined for movie nights or a beer at one of the local bars---good times!

%Science has not been my only pursuit during my time as a PhD student as I can not help but engage in the organisation I work in, perhaps it is an occupational hazard from being an entrepreneur for more than 15 years. A special thanks goes out to Daniel Michalik for dragging me into student union work, to Andrea Adden for being such a great chair of NDR and teaching me the ropes, to Andrew Lifson, Leif Gellersen and Lea Miko Versbach for taking over after me in NDR. Also a special thanks to Tanya Kolyaka and Liang Zhao for being with me in the LDK presidium, Luis Serratos and Richard Croneberg for their support and Smita Chakraborty and Harsh Shah for having the courage to take over after me. I am very grateful towards all the good and talented people that I have had the opportunity to work with in the student unions. There are indeed many, which gives me hope for the future!

%Finally, a special and warm thanks to my family and friends that have always been there for me. It means a lot to me. Jakob Thorsbro, I enjoy your yearly visits to Lund, I always look forward to them.
