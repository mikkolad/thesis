Clues to galaxy evolution from spectroscopic observations of Galactic centre stars

In this thesis results from observations of stars in the Galactic centre are presented. The results show that there are some interesting differences between the stars in the Galactic centre and stars further out. These differences may help us understand how our Galaxy evolved, and may even provide clues to theories of galaxy formation and evolution.

Brian Thorsbro studied computer science at the University of Copenhagen and then worked for 15 years in the IT industry until he realised his passion for physics. He enrolled as a student at Lund University in 2012 and joined the infrared spectroscopy group as a doctoral student at Lund Observatory in 2016. Brian Thorsbro now looks forward to continuing his work in stellar spectroscopy in Astronomy.
