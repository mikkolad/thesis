\section{Introduction}\label{sec:p1-intro}
In my first paper the aim is to establish the relationship between the efficiency of radial migration by cold torquing and the vertical action of stars. We seek to answer the question: do stars migrate equally, or less efficiently, with large vertically extended orbits? In order to study radial migration effectively, we make use of numerical or `$N$-body' simulations since it is a process which occurs over hundreds of millions of years. In addition to that, using isolated disk galaxy simulations lets us have a great deal of control over the parameter space.
