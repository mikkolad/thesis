\section{Introduction}\label{sec:p2-intro}
In Paper II we deal with the velocity distribution of local stars which was discussed in the previous chapter. Specifically, we determine the velocity distribution and velocity moments of Solar neighbourhood white dwarfs (WDs) in Gaia EDR3. In order to do this we make use of the methods derived in \cite{dehnen:98a} and \cite{dehnen:98b} which up until this point had not been employed for new data since Hipparcos. Since the method does not rely on any measurements of radial velocity the WDs are ideal candidates who very rarely have such measurements provided. 

The velocity distribution is a powerful tool to decode the evolution of the Milky Way's components as the community has been able to show in the past few decades. Recent research has been able to show a staggering amount of substructure in the velocity distributions \citep{antoja:12, kushniruk:17, dr2:kinematics} where we can see individual velocity structure up to hundreds of km s$^{-1}$ away from Solar motion as well as horizontal arches that span across the distribution. In addition to classical motions in $U, V, W$, the field has grown to include distributions in actions and angles, called orbit space (e.g., \citealt{trick:19, trick:21, trick:22}). In orbit space we can see clear ridges that are linked closely to the various structures in velocity space. Going forwards, both of these velocity spaces will be important to understand the dynamical structure of the Milky Way.

The WDs has, as mentioned, not been as easy to probe as the rest of the stars in the Solar neighbourhood. This leads to smaller samples which a couple of decades ago were only in the few hundreds \citep{sion:77, sion:88} and more recently samples which range from a couple of thousand to a few tens of thousands \citep{rowell:11, anguiano:17}. Recent works that investigate the kinematics of WDs are \cite{torres:19} who used Gaia to identify the \textit{Hercules} stream in the WDs and \cite{raddi:22} who determined the local kinematic properties of WDs. These samples are about as large as they come, with {$\gtrsim$}10 000 and {$\sim$}3000 for the two papers respectively. In my second paper, our method provides us with a sample of 129 675 WDs, the largest to date. We use this sample to identify known substructure as well as some novel features in velocity space. In addition to this, we also manage to identify two kinematically separate WD populations, attributed to the two bifurcated WD sequences seen in \cite{dr2:hr}, and likely linked to recent star formation which has been suggested to match flybys of nearby dwarf galaxies \citep{ruiz-lara:20}.

Stars are sometimes called `nuclear foundries', as they fuse hydrogen into helium they create outward thermal pressure which upholds the star to gravitational pressure in hydrostatic equilibrium. The hydrogen is not infinite and eventually runs out and the star contracts, shedding its outer layers while the core begins fusing helium into heavier elements, creating a planetary nebular around it. For massive stars, the core is large enough that many heavier elements can start fusing but for stars between about $0.6-10\ \mathrm{M}_\odot$, at some point what is called electron degeneracy\footnote{Electron degeneracy pressure and more is explained in \cite{kippenhahn:12}} occurs and provides the necessary outward pressure. The star no longer fuses and all that is left is the core, a stellar `corpse' called a white dwarf is born. This is the fate of 97\% of all stars in the Milky Way \cite{fontaine:01}. The WD will live for a long time, but still cools slowly, growing fainter and redder over time which can be seen in the colour-magnitude diagram (CMD) of WDs, shown in Fig. \ref{fig:cmd}. The WD will be difficult to observe photometrically, as it is rather faint, and spectroscopically, due to the metals sinking below the observable photosphere as well as thermal broadening. 

Despite this, Gaia is able to observe quite a large number of WDs photometrically. In the Solar Neighbourhood (within 500 pc) we can, after some quality cuts, find about 130 000 WDs in EDR3. However, if we use an even closer sample limited to 100 pc, we can observe that the WD sequence is in fact not singular, but split into two. This result was first identified in \cite{dr2:hr} and has had two major suggestions put forth to explain it. Explanation \textbf{a)} suggests that the second sequence arises due to atmospheric differences in WDs. The upper, redder, sequence have hydrogen-dominated spectra (called DAs and constitutes {$\sim$}80\% of observed WDs) whereas the lower, bluer, sequence contains WDs with Helium (called DBs) or heavier elements dominating their atmospheres. We can refer to this simply as DAs or non-DAs for the purposes of Paper II. This explanation has shown to be able to explain the bifurcation very well in works like that of \cite{kilic:18, kilic:20} and \cite{gentile-fusilo:19}. Another recent discovery about the WDs is that their mass distribution is bimodal, with a main Gaussian centered on ${\sim}0.6\ \mathrm{M}_\odot$ and a secondary, smaller Gaussian around ${\sim}0.8\ \mathrm{M}_\odot$ (e.g., \citealt{elbadry:18, kilic:18, kilic:20}). This has lead to explanation \textbf{b)} that the second sequence could consists of heavier mass WDs, which have fainter and bluer cooling tracks. In single star evolution, the more massive WDs would come from more massive progenitors, which then become WDs much faster as well. For this reason they would have colder kinematics due to the age-dispersion relation \citep{aumer:16}. Mergers were suggested as a source of massive WDs but was ruled out by \cite{kilic:20} who failed to discover significant massive WDs with hot kinematics. Instead \cite{elbadry:18} shows that with the right choice of initial-final mass relation and continuous star formation, the second sequence can be populated by late-forming WDs. In summary, the second sequence can be explained as massive WDs formed recently. 

The two scenarios can be distinguished by their kinematics. The atmospheric composition should not have any bearing on the kinematics while, as explained above, the mass of WDs does. Therefore, we can investigate the kinematics of the two populations and try to provide insight into the bifurcation. 

\section{Inferring $f_v$}\label{sec:p2-inferring}
\begin{figure}[t]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{images/projection.pdf}
    \caption{An illustration of positions on the celestial sphere from the point of view of a Solar system observer.} % Fig. 4.2
    \label{fig:projection}
\end{figure}
As shown in \cite{dehnen:98b}, the mean motion $\langle\pmb{v}\rangle$ and velocity dispersion $\pmb{\sigma}$ can be determined for a sample of stars given a few caveats. The on-sky positions have to be uncorrelated with the velocities, which means that we see the same velocities regardless of where on the sky we look. Consider the regions shown in Fig. \ref{fig:projection}. If there is a general mean motion for all parts of the sky, the line-of-sight motion of the red region will be given by the azimuthal component of tangential motion from either pink or green regions. Conversely, the azimuthal motion of stars in the red region will give the line-of-sight motion of the other two components. 

The same concept was used for the even more impressive feat of inferring the velocity distribution of Hipparcos stars in \cite{dehnen:98a}. We can write the probability distribution of tangential or transverse velocities in a given direction $\hat{\pmb{r}}$ as $\rho(\pmb{q|\hat{\pmb{r}}})$ where $\pmb{q}$ is the 2D vector of tangential velocities. To relate this distribution to the full velocity distribution we can write
\begin{equation}
    \rho(\pmb{q|\hat{\pmb{r}}}) = \int \mathrm{d}v_r f(\pmb{v}) = \int \mathrm{d}v_r f(\pmb{p} + v_r\hat{\pmb{r}}),
\end{equation}
where $\pmb{p}$ is the 3D projection of the tangential motion. The true distribution can of course not be determined using transverse motion alone but it can be estimated with a log-likelihood maximization of some model of it. We do this numerically by defining the velocity distribution to be
\begin{equation}
    f(\pmb{v}) = e^{\phi(\pmb{v})},
\end{equation}
where $\phi(\pmb{v})$ is given on a 3D velocity grid with $L_U\times L_V\times L_W$ cells with widths $h_U\times h_V\times h_W$. The final expression for the likelihood we seek to maximize, as a function of $\phi(\pmb{v})$, is:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:mple}
    \scalemath{0.8}{\tilde{\mathscr{Q}}_\alpha(\pmb{\phi}) = 
    \overbrace{N^{-1}\sum_{k} \ln \left[\sum_{\pmb{l}}e^{\phi_{\pmb{l}}}K(k|\pmb{l})\right]}^\text{\large Sum of PDF} - 
    \underbrace{\sum_{\pmb{l}}e^{\phi_{\pmb{l}}}}_\text{\large \hbox to 0cm{\hss Normalizing term \hss}} - 
    \overbrace{\frac{1}{2}\alpha h_xh_yh_z\sum_{\pmb{l}}\left(\sum_{\pmb{n}} \phi_{\pmb{n}}\Xi_{\pmb{n}\pmb{l}}\right)^2}^\text{\large penalizing term}.
    }
\end{equation}
Here, $N$ is the sample size, $\alpha$ is the smoothing parameter, $\Xi$ describes how the penalty relates to neighbouring cells, and $K(k|\pmb{l})$ is for each star $k$, the length of the line through each cell, $\pmb{l}$, formed by its tangential velocity and all possible radial velocities. 

To determine $\alpha$, we make use of the Gaia RVS. By selecting some reasonable range of test values for $\alpha$, we run the maximization on a corresponding sample of stars with measured radial velocities, in this case main-sequence stars. Since we know the velocity distribution of this sample, we can then choose the $\alpha$ that best reproduces the distribution of this calibration sample. Since the best choice of $\alpha$ depends on sample size, the calibration sample is picked so as to have about the same number of sources as the WD sample and uses an identical grid.

We chose a grid of $\pmb{n} = [100, 100, 72]$ cells with velocity ranges:
\begin{align*}
    U \in& [-150, 150]\ \mathrm{km\ s}^{-1} \\
    V \in& [-150, 50]\ \mathrm{km\ s}^{-1} \\
    W \in& [-80, 60]\ \mathrm{km\ s}^{-1},
\end{align*}
which provides a resolution of about $\Delta v = [3, 2, 2]\ \mathrm{km\ s}^{-1}$. The algorithm is also set up to use a so-called multigrid approach, where the solution is first found on a coarser grid which is interpolated and used as an initial guess for the maximization on a finer grid. This refinement occurs $3-5$ times depending on the grid size.

Shown also are the different sub-samples with the top row showing the different bifurcated sequences, the middle row shows the magnitude bins mentioned in section \ref{sec:p2-inferring}. The bottom row shows the same magnitude bins subtracted by the mean of the three, to highlight where each bin is strongest or weakest. At the bottom is shown the first nine groups identified in \cite{antoja:12} for comparison.} % Fig. 4.2
    \label{fig:wd_fv}
\end{figure}
We split the WD sample by the bifurcation (between 12 and 14th magnitude where it is strongest) as well as into three equally sized magnitude bins, which we simply call \textit{A}, \textit{B}, and \textit{C} from brightest to faintest. The resulting velocity distributions in $U-V$ are seen in Fig. \ref{fig:wd_fv}. While the other velocity spaces are also available (and shown in the paper) the $U-V$ space shows the most structure. The overall shape can be quickly identified to match well with the known distribution of the main-sequence stars as seen in Fig. \ref{fig:veldist}. The magnitude bins can be seen increasing in velocity dispersion as they go from \textit{A} to \textit{C}, reflecting the age-dispersion relation. As the dispersion becomes larger, \textit{C} appears to have arch-like features as well, marked in the plot with red lines. The relative distributions on the third row has an unexpected result. We naturally would expect the more centrally fixated samples \textit{A} and \textit{B} to dominated close to the origin and \textit{C} would dominate further out. This is mostly the case apart from a small region around $(U, V) \approx (7, -19)\ \mathrm{km\ s}^{-1}$. The region does not match conclusively with any known moving group and only \cite{kushniruk:17} provides a nearby link to \textit{Coma Berenices} which has a suggested dynamical origin in \cite{monari:18}. 

The bifurcated regions are seen in the top row and show similar dynamical features. However, the velocity dispersion of the red sample is clearly larger than the blue. This hints of hotter kinematics and as such, we look to the dispersion of the samples rather than the full distribution for further analysis. 
\section{Two kinematic populations}\label{sec:p2-populations}
\begin{figure}[t]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{images/moving_dispersion.pdf}
    \caption{Moving velocity dispersion calculated in the three directions of $U$, $V$, and $W$, for the bifurcated sequences between 12th and 14th magnitude where they are visible. \textit{a.} shows the moving dispersion for the red and blue sequences as well as the joint sample using WDs which are closer than 100 pc. The shaded regions show the 1$\sigma$ uncertainty regions. \textit{b.} same as the a. but for WDs up to 200 pc. Both plots show clearly a separation between the red and blue samples and when the 200 pc sample is used, they barely even overlap within 1$\sigma$.} % Fig. 4.3
    \label{fig:moving_disp}
\end{figure}
We use the same method as in \cite{dehnen:98b} to determine the velocity distribution for a sample of stars. But we also employ a moving window across the visible bifurcation to better compare the sequences as they cool. The velocity distributions in Fig. \ref{fig:wd_fv} used WDs within 500 pc, whereas here we use WDs limited to either 100 pc or 200 pc, the result of which can be seen in Fig. \ref{fig:moving_disp}. Here it can be clearly seen for the 200 pc sample that the red sequence has larger kinematics across all magnitudes. For the 100 pc sample this is also visible but less so. We can however show that the two samples are drawn from the same underlying distribution. We determine the $Q$-statistic for the two dispersion of the samples at various points: 
\begin{equation}
    Q = \frac{\sigma_{d_1} - \sigma_{d_2}}{\sqrt{\Delta \sigma_{d_1}^2 + \Delta \sigma_{d_2}^2}},
\end{equation}
where $d_1$ is the 100 pc sample and $d_2$ are stars between 100-200 pc. Both the red and blue Cumulative Distribution Functions (CDF) matches well with a Gaussian distribution, and using a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test gives $P$-values between them and a true Gaussian which all lie above 0.8. Therefore, the difference between the two figures is simply statistical noise. 

This shows that the two sequences between magnitudes 12 and 14 are \textit{kinematically separate and distinct populations}. In regards to the discussion in section \ref{sec:p2-whitedwarfs}, this would agree well with the two sequences being comprised of different masses where the heavier mass WDs are formed recently, giving them less time to be heated dynamically and thus forming the blue sample we have seen here. It cannot be ruled out the atmospheric composition is partly responsible for the bifurcation in the CMD but it cannot be the sole explanation. In our 100 pc samples, we cross-matched with the Montreal White Dwarf Database \citep{dufour:17} to find that 85\% of the cross-matched red sample and 39\% of the blue are DAs, so there are undoubtedly non-DAs in the second sequence. If they truly correspond to 60\%, they still do not significantly alter the kinematics of the sample as a whole. It can be argued that the crystallization of massive WDs would provide massive WDs which are still visible in our range due to cooling delays (e.g., \citealt{tremblay:19, bergeron:19, bauer:20}). If this were the case, these massive WDs would have had the necessary time to dynamically heat. If this process is contaminating the sample, the fact that we still see the kinematic split is arguably even more significant.

Further insight into the bifurcation of the WD sequence will likely require a combination of studied both spectroscopic and kinematic. Here, we have demonstrated the possibilities of working with only proper motions when analysing the vastness of the Gaia data.
