\subsubsection*{My contribution:}
After the second paper, DM and PM had the original idea to expand the method and apply it to other data sets. DM and PM chose two new data sets which were a large Solar neighbourhood sample and a stellar halo sample. PM provided literature sources for velocity distributions of the stellar halo. DM acquired the data and filtered it for quality. DM implemented conversion into spherical velocity coordinates in the code and ran the algorithm to produce probability distributions. The analysis in velocities was carried out by DM, with support from PM and DH and minor contributions from PM. DM wrote the paper which was reviewed by PM and DH to bring it to a submittable state.
