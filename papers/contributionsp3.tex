\subsubsection*{My contribution:}
After the second paper, DM and PM had the original idea to expand the method and apply it to other datasets. DM and PM chose two new datasets the largest Solar neighbourhood sample and the stellar halo. PM provided literature sources for velocity distributions of the stellar halo. DM acquired the data and filtered it for quality. DM implemented spherical velocity coordinates into the code and ran the algortithm to produce probability distributions. The analysis in velocities was carried out by DM, with support from PM and DH. PM analysed the data in action space. DM wrote the paper apart from the actions-related section which was written by PM and the paper was reviewed by PM and DH to bring it to a submittable state.
