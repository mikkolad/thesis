\subsubsection*{My contribution:}
The original idea came from PM to apply the method of \cite{dehnen:98a} to DR2 \citep{dr2}. John Wimarsson (JW) wrote the initial, core parts of the code with support from DM and PM. DM overtook responsibility and finished writing the code and developed all of the analysis tools. Further developments for the code were implemented with input from PM and DH, including the multigrid approach. DM and PM chose white dwarfs as targets and DM acquired the data from the Gaia archive. DM carried out the analysis with guidance from his supervisors DH and PM. DM reviewed existing literature on velocity distributions as well as white dwarfs and their bifurcation. DM wrote the paper, with rounds of review between DM, PM, and DH. DM submitted the report and went through editing rounds with an anonymous referee's useful comments which lead to further clarity and discussion in the paper. The paper was then accepted for publication.
