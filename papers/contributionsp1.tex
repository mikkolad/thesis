\subsubsection*{My contribution:}
Paul McMillan (PM) had the original idea for the paper after reading about the role of migration for large vertical excursions in \cite{solway:12} and \cite{vera-ciro:14, vera-ciro:16b}. Daniel Mikkola (DM) set up and ran the numerical simulations and wrote all of the analysis tools that were used. David Hobbs (DH) and PM advised on choice of simulation code and on what analysis to perform. Outputs of simulations were analyzed by DM with guidance by his supervisors DH and PM and discussed by DM, PM, and DH. PM provided literature resources for the writing and DM wrote and submitted the manuscript. Several rounds of revisions, feedback, and discussions between the authors as well as with an anonymous referee led to the final product which was accepted for publication.
